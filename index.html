    <strong>Why do you want to join:</strong><br />
    I am a hard worker, who doesn't rest until the job is done and done correctly and accurately. I work very well in a group and I am very honest. I love working on minecraft servers wheater that would be building or setting up plugins. 

When ever I have a job or task to complete I always ensure that the quality of the work is at it's best, I believe in going above and beyond and going that extra mile to make people happy. Well obviously I want to minimize the amount of rule breaking and create an enjoyable experience for the whole player base. 

But more to the point I would like to become staff to help and encourage new players, provide them any assistance they may need, and generally aid any player in any way they require in a polite, respectful and accelerated manner. Finally I would like to help relieve some of the stress of the other staff members by being active and helping consistently. I could bring my commitment, I would try my very hardest to provide players with informative and helpful answers to all their queries, I would do this frequently to make sure all players have an enjoyable experience. Also because of my previous experience I have a great understanding of appropriate sanctions and the best means to deter rule breakers, by simply making fair unbiased decisions. 

Also I have high amounts of time and patience, which I think would be essential when helping players come to grips with rules and any problems that have. <br />
